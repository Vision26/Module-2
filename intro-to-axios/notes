# Intro to Axios
    - Axios can be downloaded as a node_module, or attained through a CDN
    - A CDN, or Content Deliver Network, is loaded into your application through a script tag on your html page.
        - The axios CDN can be found on cdnjs.com's website: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/axios
        
    - Axios is a promise based HTTP client.
    - This means it allows us to make HTTP requests, and the handling of those requests and the subsequent responses on the front end is handled with promises.

       - For these lessons we will be using the V school Todo API as it will allow us to practice all four of the HTTP methods we are learning.  The documentation can be found here:

        # PUT request

    - The put request is for updating an existing item in a database
    - The method will need both the id of the item to update, and the data in which it will be updated with.
